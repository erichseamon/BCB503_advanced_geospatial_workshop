## Load the Data

#To work with vector data in R, we can use the `sf` library. The `raster`
#package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
#raster and vector files. Make sure that you have these packages loaded.

#We will continue to work with the three shapefiles that we loaded in the
#Open and Plot Shapefiles in R episode.

## Plotting Multiple Shapefiles

#In the previous episode,
#we learned how to plot information from a single shapefile and do
#some plot customization including adding a custom legend. However,
#what if we want to create a more complex plot with many shapefiles
#and unique symbols that need to be represented clearly in a legend?

#Now, let's create a plot that combines our tower location (`point_HARV`),
#site boundary (`aoi_boundary_HARV`) and roads (`lines_HARV`) spatial objects. 
#We will need to build a custom legend as well.

#To begin, we will create a plot with the site boundary as the first layer. 
#Then layer the tower location and road data on top using `+`.

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
  coord_sf()


#Next, let's build a custom legend using the symbology (the colors and symbols)
#that we used to create the plot above. For example, it might be good if the 
#lines were symbolized as lines. In the previous episode, you may have 
#noticed that the default legend behavior for `geom_sf` is to draw a 
#'patch' for each legend entry. If you want the legend to draw lines 
#or points, you need to add an instruction to the `geom_sf` call - 
#in this case, `show.legend = 'line'`. 

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE),
          show.legend = "line", size = 1) +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), color = "black") +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black") +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
  coord_sf()


#Now lets adjust the legend titles by passing a `name` to the respective 
#`color` and `fill` palettes.

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type)) +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line",
          size = 1) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors, name = "Line Type") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = "black", name = "Tower Location") + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
  coord_sf()

#Finally, it might be better if the points were symbolized as a symbol. 
#We can customize this using `shape` parameters in our call to `geom_sf`: 16 
#is a point symbol, 15 is a box.

## Data Tip
#To view a short list of `shape` symbols,
#type `?pch` into the R console.


ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, fill = "grey", color = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = point_HARV, aes(fill = Sub_Type), shape = 15) +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE),
          show.legend = "line", size = 1) +

## Challenge: Plot Polygon by Attribute

#1. Using the `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/PlotLocations_HARV.shp` 
#shapefile, create a map of study plot locations, with each point colored 
#by the soil type (`soilTypeOr`). How many different soil types are 
#there at this particular field site? Overlay this layer on top of the 
#`lines_HARV` layer (the roads). Create a custom legend that applies line 
#symbols to lines and point symbols to the points.

#2. Modify the plot above. Tell R to plot each point, using a different
#symbol of `shape` value.

## Answers

#First we need to read in the data and see how many
#unique soils are represented in the `soilTypeOr` attribute.

plot_locations <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/PlotLocations_HARV.shp")

levels(plot_locations$soilTypeOr)



#Next we can create a new color palette with one color for
#each soil type.

blue_green <- c("blue", "darkgreen")

#Finally, we will create our plot.

ggplot() + 
   geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line") + 
   geom_sf(data = plot_locations, aes(fill = soilTypeOr), 
           shape = 21, color = NA, show.legend = 'point') + 
   scale_color_manual(name = "Line Type", values = road_colors,
     guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = "solid", shape = NA))) + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Soil Type", values = blue_green,
      guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = "blank", shape = 21, colour = NA))) + ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + coord_sf()


#If we want each soil to be shown with a different symbol, we can
#give multiple values to the `scale_shape_manual()` argument.

ggplot() + 
   geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), show.legend = "line", size = 1) + 
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations, aes(fill = soilTypeOr, shape = soilTypeOr),
           show.legend = 'point', colour = NA, size = 3) + 
   scale_shape_manual(name = "Soil Type", values = c(21, 22)) +
   scale_color_manual(name = "Line Type", values = road_colors,
      guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = "solid", shape = NA))) + 
   scale_fill_manual(name = "Soil Type", values = blue_green,
      guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = "blank", shape = c(21, 22),
      color = blue_green))) + 
   ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") + 
   coord_sf()


## Challenge: Plot Raster & Vector Data Together

#You can plot vector data layered on top of raster data using the 
#`+` to add a layer in `ggplot`. Create a plot that uses the NEON AOI
#Canopy Height Model `NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif`
#as a base layer. On top of the CHM, please add:

#* The study site AOI.
#* Roads.
#* The tower location.

#Be sure to give your plot a meaningful title.

## Answers

ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = CHM_HARV_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_chmCrop)) +
   geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, color = "black") +
   geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, color = "grey20", size = 1) +
   geom_sf(data = point_HARV, pch = 8) +
   ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site w/ Canopy Height Model") +
