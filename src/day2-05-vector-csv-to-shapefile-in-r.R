#This episode will review how to import spatial points stored in 
#`.csv` (Comma Separated Value) format into R as an `sf` spatial object. 
#We will also reproject data imported from a shapefile format, 
#export this data as a shapefile, and plot raster and vector 
#data as layers in the same plot.

## Spatial Data in Text Format

#The `HARV_PlotLocations.csv` file contains `x, y` (point) locations 
#for study plot where NEON collects data on vegetation and other 
#ecological metrics

#We would like to:

#* Create a map of these plot locations.
#* Export the data in a `shapefile` format to share with our colleagues. This
#shapefile can be imported into any GIS software.
#* Create a map showing vegetation height with plot locations layered on top.

#Spatial data are sometimes stored in a text file format (`.txt` or `.csv`). 
#If the text file has an associated `x` and `y` location column, 
#then we can convert it into an `sf` spatial object. The `sf` object 
#allows us to store both the `x,y` values that represent the coordinate 
#location of each point and the associated attribute data - or 
#columns describing each feature in the spatial object.

#We will continue using the `sf` and `raster` packages in this episode.

## Import .csv

#To begin let's import a `.csv` file that contains plot coordinate `x, y`
#locations at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site (`HARV_PlotLocations.csv`) 
#and look at the structure of that new object:

plot_locations_HARV <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_PlotLocations.csv")

str(plot_locations_HARV)


#We now have a data frame that contains 21 locations (rows) and 16 
#variables (attributes). Note that all of our character data was imported 
#into R as factor (categorical) data. Next, let's explore the dataframe 
#to determine whether it contains columns with coordinate values. If we 
#are lucky, our `.csv` will contain columns labeled:

#* "X" and "Y" OR
#* Latitude and Longitude OR
#* easting and northing (UTM coordinates)

#Let's check out the column names of our dataframe.

names(plot_locations_HARV)


## Identify X,Y Location Columns

#Our column names include several fields that might contain spatial 
#information. The `plot_locations_HARV$easting`
#and `plot_locations_HARV$northing` columns contain coordinate values. 
#We can confirm this by looking at the first six rows of our data.

head(plot_locations_HARV$easting)
head(plot_locations_HARV$northing)


#We have coordinate values in our data frame. In order to convert our
#data frame to an `sf` object, we also need to know the CRS
#associated with those coordinate values.

#There are several ways to figure out the CRS of spatial data in text format.

#1. We can check the file metadata in hopes that the CRS was recorded in the
#data.
#2. We can explore the file itself to see if CRS information is embedded 
#in the file header or somewhere in the data columns.

#Following the `easting` and `northing` columns, there is a `geodeticDa` 
#and a `utmZone` column. These appear to contain CRS information
#(`datum` and `projection`). Let's view those next.

head(plot_locations_HARV$geodeticDa)
head(plot_locations_HARV$utmZone)


#It is not typical to store CRS information in a column. But this particular
#file contains CRS information this way. The `geodeticDa` and `utmZone` 
#columns contain the information that helps us determine the CRS:

#* `geodeticDa`: WGS84  -- this is geodetic datum WGS84
#* `utmZone`: 18

#In When Vector Data Don't Line Up - Handling Spatial Projection & CRS in R
#we learned about the components of a `proj4` string. We have everything
#we need to assign a CRS to our data frame.

#To create the `proj4` associated with UTM Zone 18 WGS84 we can look up the
#projection on the Spatial Reference website
#http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18n/, 
#which contains a list of CRS formats for each projection. From here, 
#we can extract the proj4 string for UTM Zone 18N WGS84
#http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-18n/proj4/).

#However, if we have other data in the UTM Zone 18N projection, it's much
#easier to use the `st_crs()` function to extract the CRS in `proj4` 
#format from that object and assign it to our new spatial object. 
#We've seen this CRS before with our Harvard Forest study site (`point_HARV`).

st_crs(point_HARV)

#The output above shows that the points shapefile is in
#UTM zone 18N. We can thus use the CRS from that spatial object to convert our
#non-spatial dataframe into an `sf` object.

#Next, let's create a `crs` object that we can use to define the CRS of our
#`sf` object when we create it.

utm18nCRS <- st_crs(point_HARV)
utm18nCRS

class(utm18nCRS)


## .csv to sf object

#Next, let's convert our dataframe into an `sf` object. To do
#this, we need to specify:

#1. The columns containing X (`easting`) and Y (`northing`) coordinate values

#2. The CRS that the column coordinate represent (units are included in the CRS) - stored in our `utmCRS` object.

#We will use the `st_as_sf()` function to perform the conversion.

plot_locations_sp_HARV <- st_as_sf(plot_locations_HARV, coords = c("easting", "northing"), crs = utm18nCRS)


#We should double check the CRS to make sure it is correct.

st_crs(plot_locations_sp_HARV)


## Plot Spatial Object
#We now have a spatial R object, we can plot our newly created spatial object.

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV) +
  ggtitle("Map of Plot Locations")


## Plot Extent

#In Open and Plot Shapefiles in R
#we learned about spatial object extent. When we plot several spatial layers 
#in R using `ggplot`, all of the layers of the plot are considered in 
#setting the boundaries of the plot. To show this, let's plot our 
#`aoi_boundary_HARV` object with our vegetation plots.

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV) +
  geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV) +
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot")

#When we plot the two layers together, `ggplot` sets the plot boundaries
#so that they are large enough to include all of the data included in all 
#of the layers. That's really handy!

## Challenge - Import & Plot Additional Points

#We want to add two phenology plots to our existing map of vegetation plot
#locations.

#Import the .csv: `HARV/HARV_2NewPhenPlots.csv` into R and do the following:

#1. Find the X and Y coordinate locations. Which value is X and which value is Y?
#2. These data were collected in a geographic coordinate system (WGS84). Convert
#the dataframe into an `sf` object.
#3. Plot the new points with the plot location points from above. Be sure to add
#a legend. Use a different symbol for the 2 new points!

#If you have extra time, feel free to add roads and other layers to your map!

## Answers

#1)
#First we will read in the new csv file and look at the
#data structure.

newplot_locations_HARV <-
 read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_2NewPhenPlots.csv")
 str(newplot_locations_HARV)

 #2)
 #The US boundary data we worked with previously is in a geographic
 #WGS84 CRS. We can use that data to establish a CRS for this data. First
 #we will extract the CRS from the `country_boundary_US` object and
 #confirm that it is WGS84.

 geogCRS <- st_crs(country_boundary_US)
 geogCRS


 #Then we will convert our new data to a spatial dataframe, using
 #the `geogCRS` object as our CRS.

newPlot.Sp.HARV <- st_as_sf(newplot_locations_HARV, coords = c("decimalLon", "decimalLat"), crs = geogCRS)


#Next we'll confirm that the CRS for our new object is correct.

st_crs(newPlot.Sp.HARV)


#We will be adding these new data points to the plot we
#created before. The data for the earlier plot was in UTM.
#Since we're using `ggplot`, it will reproject the data for us.

#3) Now we can create our plot.

 ggplot() +
   geom_sf(data = plot_locations_sp_HARV, color = "orange") +
   geom_sf(data = newPlot.Sp.HARV, color = "lightblue") +
   ggtitle("Map of All Plot Locations")



## Export a Shapefile

 #We can write an R spatial object to a shapefile using the `st_write` function
 #in `sf`. To do this we need the following arguments:

 #* the name of the spatial object (`plot_locations_sp_HARV`)
 #* the directory where we want to save our shapefile
 #           (to use `current = getwd()` or you can specify a different path)
 #* the name of the new shapefile  (`PlotLocations_HARV`)
 #* the driver which specifies the file format (ESRI Shapefile)

 #We can now export the spatial object as a shapefile.

st_write(plot_locations_sp_HARV,
         "data/PlotLocations_HARV.shp", driver = "ESRI Shapefile")
