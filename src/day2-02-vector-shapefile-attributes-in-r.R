#This episode continues our discussion of shapefile attributes and 
#covers how to work with shapefile attributes in R. It covers how
#to identify and query shapefile attributes, as well as how to subset 
#shapefiles by specific attribute values. Finally, we will learn how 
#to plot a shapefile according to a set of attribute values.

## Load the Data
#We will continue using the `sf`, `raster` and `ggplot2` packages in 
#this episode. Make sure that you have these packages loaded. We will 
#continue to work with the three shapefiles that we loaded in the
#Open and Plot Shapefiles in R episode.

## Query Shapefile Metadata

#As we discussed previously, we can view metadata associated 
#with an R object using:

#* `st_geometry_type()` - The type of vector data stored in the object.
#* `nrow()` - The number of features in the object
#* `st_bbox()` - The spatial extent (geographic area covered by) 
#of the object.
#* `st_crs()` - The CRS (spatial projection) of the data.

#We started to explore our `point_HARV` object in the previous episode.
#To see a summary of all of the metadata associated with our `point_HARV` 
#object, we can view the object with `View(point_HARV)` or print a summary 
#of the object itself to the console.

point_HARV


#We can use the `ncol` function to count the number of attributes 
#associated with a spatial object too. Note that the geometry is 
#just another column and counts towards the total.


ncol(lines_HARV)


#We can view the individual name of each attribute using the
#`names()` function in R:


names(lines_HARV)


#We could also view just the first 6 rows
#of attribute values using the `head()` function to get a 
#preview of the data:


head(lines_HARV)


## Challenge: Attributes for Different Spatial Classes

#Explore the attributes associated with the `point_HARV` and 
#`aoi_boundary_HARV` spatial objects.

#1. How many attributes does each have?
#2. Who owns the site in the `point_HARV` data object?
#3. Which of the following is NOT an attribute of the `point_HARV` 
#data object?

#    A) Latitude      B) County     C) Country

## Answers
#1) To find the number of attributes, we use the `ncol()` function: 
 

ncol(point_HARV)
ncol(aoi_boundary_HARV)


#2) Ownership information is in a column named `Ownership`: 


point_HARV$Ownership


#3) To see a list of all of the attributes, we can use the
#`names()` function:


names(point_HARV)


#"Country" is not an attribute of this object. 


## Explore Values within One Attribute
#We can explore individual values stored within a particular attribute.
#Comparing attributes to a spreadsheet or a data frame, this is similar
#to exploring values in a column. We did this with the `gapminder` 
#dataframe in an earlier lesson. For spatial objects, we can use 
#the same syntax: `objectName$attributeName`.

#We can see the contents of the `TYPE` field of our lines shapefile:


lines_HARV$TYPE


#To see only unique values within the `TYPE` field, we can use the
#`levels()` function for extracting the possible values of a
#categorical variable. The special term for categorical variables
#within R is factor. We worked with factors a little bit in an earlier lesson.


levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)


### Subset Shapefiles

#We can use the `filter()` function from `dplyr` that we worked with in 
#an earlier lesson  to select a subset of features
#from a spatial object in R, just like with data frames.

#For example, we might be interested only in features that are of 
#`TYPE` "footpath". Once we subset out this data, we can use it as 
#input to other code so that code only operates on the footpath lines.


footpath_HARV <- lines_HARV %>% 
  filter(TYPE == "footpath")
nrow(footpath_HARV)


#Our subsetting operation reduces the `features` count to 2. This means
#that only two feature lines in our spatial object have the attribute
#`TYPE == footpath`. We can plot only the footpath lines:


ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = footpath_HARV) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Footpaths") + 
  coord_sf()


#There are two features in our footpaths subset. Why does the plot look like
#there is only one feature? Let's adjust the colors used in our plot. 
#If we have 2 features in our vector object, we can plot each using a 
#unique color by assigning a column name to the color aesthetic (`color =`). 
#We use the syntax `aes(color = )` to do this. We can also alter the default 
#line thickness by using the `size =` parameter, as the default value of 
#0.5 can be hard to see. Note that size is placed outside of the `aes()` 
#function, as we are not connecting line thickness to a data variable.


ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = footpath_HARV, aes(color = factor(OBJECTID)), size = 1.5) +
  labs(color = 'Footpath ID') +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Footpaths") + 
  coord_sf()


#Now, we see that there are in fact two features in our plot!

## Challenge: Subset Spatial Line Objects Part 1
 
#Subset out all `boardwalk` from the lines layer and plot it.

## Answers
 
#First we will save an object with only the boardwalk lines:

boardwalk_HARV <- lines_HARV %>% 
filter(TYPE == "boardwalk")


#Let's check how many features there are in this subset: 


nrow(boardwalk_HARV)


#Now let's plot that data: 

ggplot() + 
   geom_sf(data = boardwalk_HARV, size = 1.5) +
   ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Boardwalks") + 
   coord_sf()



## Challenge: Subset Spatial Line Objects Part 2

#Subset out all `stone wall` features from the lines layer and plot it. 
#For each plot, color each feature using a unique color.

## Answer

#First we will save an object with only the stone wall lines
#and check the number of features: 

stoneWall_HARV <- lines_HARV %>% 
   filter(TYPE == "stone wall")
 nrow(stoneWall_HARV)


 #Now we can plot the data:


ggplot() +
geom_sf(data = stoneWall_HARV, aes(color = factor(OBJECTID)), size = 1.5) +
labs(color = 'Wall ID') +
ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Stonewalls") + 
coord_sf()



## Customize Plots

#In the examples above, `ggplot()` automatically selected colors for
#each line based on a default color order. If we don't like those
#default colors, we can create a vector of colors - one for each
#feature. To create this vector we can use the following syntax:

`c("color_one", "color_two", "color_three")[object$factor]`

#Note in the above example we have

#1. a vector of colors - one for each factor value (unique attribute value)
#2. the attribute itself (`[object$factor]`) of class factor.

#First we will check how many unique levels our factor has:


levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)


#Then we can create a pallet of four colors, one for each
#feature in our vector object.


road_colors <- c("blue", "green", "navy", "purple")


#We can tell `ggplot` to use these colors when we plot the data.


ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Roads & Trails") + 
  coord_sf()


### Adjust Line Width
#We adjusted line width universally earlier. If we want a unique line width 
#for each factor level or attribute category in our spatial object, we can 
#use the same syntax that we used for colors, above.

#We already know that we have four different `TYPE` levels in the lines_HARV 
#object, so we will set four different line widths.


line_widths <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)


#We can use those line widths when we plot the data.


ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE, size = TYPE)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') +
  scale_size_manual(values = line_widths) +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Line width varies") + 
  coord_sf()


#Note that we could also use `aes(size = TYPE)` to tie the line thickness 
#to the TYPE variable, so long as we had been careful to set factor levels 
#appropriately. ggplot prints a warning when you do this, because it is not 
#considered a good practice to plot non-spatial data this way.

## Challenge: Plot Line Width by Attribute

#In the example above, we set the line widths to be 1, 2, 3, and 4.
#Because R orders factor levels alphabetically by default,
#this gave us a plot where woods roads (the last factor level)
#were the thickest and boardwalks were the thinnest.

#Let's create another plot where we show the different line types
#with the following thicknesses:

#1. woods road size = 6
#2. boardwalks size = 1
#3. footpath size = 3
#4. stone wall size = 2

## Answers
 
#First we need to look at the levels of our factor to see
#what order the road types are in:


levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)


#We then can create our `line_width` vector setting each of the
#levels to the desired thickness.


line_width <- c(1, 3, 2, 6)


#Now we can create our plot.


ggplot() +
   geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(size = TYPE)) +
   scale_size_manual(values = line_width) +
   ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Line width varies") + coord_sf()



### Add Plot Legend

#We can add a legend to our plot too. When we add a legend, we use the 
#following elements to specify labels and colors:

#* `bottomright`: We specify the location of our legend by using a default
#keyword. We could also use `top`, `topright`, etc.
#* `levels(objectName$attributeName)`: Label the legend elements using the
#categories of levels in an attribute (e.g., levels(lines_HARV$TYPE) means use
#the levels boardwalk, footpath, etc).
#* `fill =`: apply unique colors to the boxes in our legend. `palette()` is
#the default set of colors that R applies to all plots.

#Let's add a legend to our plot. We will use the `road_colors` object
#that we created above to color the legend. We can customize the
#appearance of our legend by manually setting different parameters.


ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", 
          subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Default Legend") + 
  coord_sf()


#We can change the appearance of our legend by manually setting different 
#parameters.

#* `legend.text`: change the font size
#* `legend.box.background`: add an outline box

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = road_colors) + 
  labs(color = 'Road Type') +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 20), 
        legend.box.background = element_rect(size = 1)) + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", 
          subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Modified Legend") +
  coord_sf()



new_colors <- c("springgreen", "blue", "magenta", "orange")

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = lines_HARV, aes(color = TYPE), size = 1.5) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = new_colors) +
  labs(color = 'Road Type') +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 20), 
        legend.box.background = element_rect(size = 1)) + 
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", 
          subtitle = "Roads & Trails - Pretty Colors") +
  coord_sf()


## Data Tip

#You can modify the default R color palette
#using the palette method. For example `palette(rainbow(6))` or
#`palette(terrain.colors(6))`. You can reset the palette colors using
#`palette("default")`!


## Challenge: Plot Lines by Attribute

#Create a plot that emphasizes only roads where bicycles and horses are allowed.
#To emphasize this, make the lines where bicycles are not allowed THINNER than
#the roads where bicycles are allowed.
#NOTE: this attribute information is located in the `lines_HARV$BicyclesHo`
#attribute.
 
#Be sure to add a title and legend to your map. You might consider a color
#palette that has all bike/horse-friendly roads displayed in a bright color. All
#other lines can be black.

## Answers

#First we need to make sure that the `BicyclesHo` attribute is a
#factor and check how many levels it has.


class(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo)
levels(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo)


#Next, we will create a new object `lines_removeNA` that removes missing values.

lines_removeNA <- lines_HARV[!is.na(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo),] 


#In our plot, we will set colors so that only the allowed roads
#are magenta, and we will set line width so that the first
#factor level is thicker than the others.

# First, create a data frame with only those roads where bicycles and horses 
#are allowed

lines_showHarv <- lines_removeNA %>% filter(BicyclesHo == "Bicycles and Horses Allowed")

# Next, visualise using ggplot
ggplot() + 
   geom_sf(data = lines_HARV) + 
   geom_sf(data = lines_showHarv, aes(color = BicyclesHo), size = 2) + 
   scale_color_manual(values = "magenta") +
  ggtitle("NEON Harvard Forest Field Site", subtitle = "Roads Where Bikes and Horses Are Allowed") + coord_sf()



## Challenge: Plot Polygon by Attribute

#1. Create a map of the state boundaries in the United States using the data
#located in your downloaded data folder: 
#  `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers\US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014`.
#Apply a fill color to each state using its `region` value. Add a legend.

## Answers
#First we read in the data and check how many levels there are
#in the `region` column:

state_boundary_US <- 
st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers/US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014.shp")

levels(state_boundary_US$region)

#Next we set a color vector with that many items: 

colors <- c("purple", "springgreen", "yellow", "brown", "navy")

#Now we can create our plot: 

ggplot() +
geom_sf(data = state_boundary_US, aes(color = region), size = 1) +
scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
ggtitle("Contiguous U.S. State Boundaries") + 
coord_sf()
