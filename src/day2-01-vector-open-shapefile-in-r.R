#Starting with this episode, we will be moving from working with raster
#data to working with vector data. In this episode, we will open and plot 
#point, line and polygon vector data
#stored in shapefile format in R. These data refer to the NEON Harvard 
#Forest field site which we have been working with in previous
#episodes. In later episodes, we will learn how to work with raster and
#vector data together and combine them into a single plot.

## Import Shapefiles

#We will use the `sf` package to work with vector data in R. Notice that the
#`rgdal` package automatically loads when `sf` is loaded. We will also use the
#`raster` package, which has been loaded in previous episodes, so we can 
#explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.
#Make sure you have the `sf` library loaded. 

library(sf)


#The shapefiles that we will import are:

  #* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
  #* A line shapefile representing roads, and
  #* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher flux tower
  #located at the NEON Harvard Forest field site

  #The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our 
  #study area (or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). 
  #To import shapefiles we use the `sf` function `st_read()`. 
  #`st_read()` requires the file path to the shapefile.

#Let's import our AOI:

aoi_boundary_HARV <- st_read(
  "data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HarClip_UTMZ18.shp")

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

#When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into R (as our
#`aoi_boundary_HARV` object), the `st_read()` function automatically stores
#information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
#metadata, describing the format, CRS, extent, and other components of
#the vector data, and the attributes which describe properties associated
#with each individual vector object.

## Data Tip

#The Explore and Plot by Shapefile Attributes
#episode provides more information on both metadata and attributes
#and using attributes to subset and plot data.


## Spatial Metadata

Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

  #1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
  #2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
  #3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (i.e. geographic area that the 
  #shapefile covers) of the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent 
  #for a shapefile represents the combined
  #extent for all spatial objects in the shapefile.

  #We can view shapefile metadata using the `st_geometry_type()`, 
  #`st_crs()` and `st_bbox()` functions. First, let's view the
  #geometry type for our AOI shapefile: 

st_geometry_type(aoi_boundary_HARV)

#Our `aoi_boundary_HARV` is a polygon object. The 18 levels shown below
#our output list the possible categories of the geometry type. 
#Now let's check what CRS this file data is in:

st_crs(aoi_boundary_HARV)


#Our data in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to 
#interpreting the object's extent values as it specifies units. To find
#the extent of our AOI, we can use the `st_bbox()` function: 

st_bbox(aoi_boundary_HARV)


#The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents 
#the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, 
#south east and west. Thus is represents the overall geographic 
#coverage of the spatial object.

#Lastly, we can view all of the metadata and attributes for this
#shapefile object by printing it to the screen:

aoi_boundary_HARV

## Spatial Data Attributes
#We introduced the idea of spatial data attributes in an earlier lesson. 
#Now we will explore how to use spatial data attributes stored 
#in our data to plot different features.

## Plot a Shapefile

#Next, let's visualize the data in our `sf` object using the `ggplot`
#package. Unlike with raster data, we do not need to convert vector
#data to a dataframe before plotting with `ggplot`. 

#We're going to customize our boundary plot by setting the 
#size, color, and fill for our plot. When plotting `sf` objects 
#with `ggplot2`, you need to use the `coord_sf()` coordinate system.

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi_boundary_HARV, size = 3, color = "black", fill = "cyan1") + 
  ggtitle("AOI Boundary Plot") + 
  coord_sf()


## Challenge: Import Line and Point Shapefiles

#Using the steps above, import the HARV_roads and HARVtower_UTM18N 
#layers into R. Call the HARV_roads object `lines_HARV` and the 
#HARVtower_UTM18N `point_HARV`.

#Answer the following questions:

#1. What type of R spatial object is created when you import each layer?
 
#2. What is the CRS and extent for each object?
 
#3. Do the files contain points, lines, or polygons?

#4. How many spatial objects are in each file?

## Answers

#First we import the data: 
lines_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARV_roads.shp")
point_HARV <- st_read("data/NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp")


#Then we check its class: 

class(lines_HARV)
class(point_HARV)

#We also check the CRS and extent of each object: 

st_crs(lines_HARV)
st_bbox(lines_HARV)
st_crs(point_HARV)
st_bbox(point_HARV)


#To see the number of objects in each file, we can look at the output 
#from when we read these objects into R.

#`lines_HARV` contains 13 features (all lines) and `point_HARV` contains only one point.
