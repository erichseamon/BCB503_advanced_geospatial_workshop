# Learners will have these data loaded from earlier episode
# DSM data for Harvard Forest

DSM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

DSM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_HARV, xy = TRUE)

# DTM data for Harvard Forest
DTM_HARV <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")

DTM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(DTM_HARV, xy = TRUE)

# DSM data for SJER
DSM_SJER <- raster("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/SJER/DSM/SJER_dsmCrop.tif")

DSM_SJER_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_SJER, xy = TRUE)

# DTM data for SJER

#We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters 
#to create a new output raster. This episode covers how to subtract 
#one raster from another using basic raster math and the `overlay()` 
#function. It also covers how to extract pixel values from a set of 
#locations - for example a buffer region around plot locations at a field site.

## Raster Calculations in R

#We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create 
#a new output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the 
#heights of trees across an entire field site, we might want to 
#calculate the difference between the Digital Surface Model 
#(DSM, tops of trees) and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). 
#The resulting dataset is referred to as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) 
#and represents the actual height of trees, buildings, etc. with 
#the influence of ground elevation removed.

### Load the Data
#For this episode, we will use the DTM and DSM from the
#NEON Harvard Forest Field site and San Joaquin Experimental
#Range, which we already have loaded from previous episodes.

## Exercise
#Use the `GDALinfo()` function to view information about the DTM and
#DSM data files. Do the two rasters have the same or different CRSs
#and resolutions? Do they both have defined minimum and maximum values?

## Solution
GDALinfo("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
GDALinfo("data/NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")



#We've already loaded and worked with these two data files in
#earlier episodes. Let's plot them each once more to remind ourselves
#what this data looks like. First we'll plot the DTM elevation data: 

 ggplot() +
      geom_raster(data = DTM_HARV_df , 
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dtmCrop)) +
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
     coord_quickmap()


#And then the DSM elevation data: 

 ggplot() +
      geom_raster(data = DSM_HARV_df , 
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = HARV_dsmCrop)) +
     scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
     coord_quickmap()


## Two Ways to Perform Raster Calculations

#We can calculate the difference between two rasters in two different ways:

# 1. by directly subtracting the two rasters in R using raster math

#2. or for more efficient processing - particularly if our rasters are 
 #large and/or the calculations we are performing are complex: using 
 #the `overlay()` function.

## Raster Math & Canopy Height Models

#We can perform raster calculations by subtracting (or adding,
#multiplying, etc) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this
#"raster math".

#Let's subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height Model. 
#After subtracting, let's create a dataframe so we can plot with `ggplot`.

CHM_HARV <- DSM_HARV - DTM_HARV

CHM_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_HARV, xy = TRUE)


#We can now plot the output CHM.

 ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = CHM_HARV_df , 
               aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) + 
   scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
   coord_quickmap()


#Let's have a look at the distribution of values in our newly created
#Canopy Height Model (CHM).

ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(layer))


#Notice that the range of values for the output CHM is between 0 and 30 
#meters. Does this make sense for trees in Harvard Forest?

## Challenge: Explore CHM Raster Values

#It's often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.

#1. What is the min and maximum value for the Harvard Forest Canopy Height Model (`CHM_HARV`) that we just created?
#2. What are two ways you can check this range of data for `CHM_HARV`?
#3. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM?
#4. Plot a histogram with 6 bins instead of the default and change the color of the histogram.
#5. Plot the `CHM_HARV` raster using breaks that make sense for the data. 
#Include an appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and 
#no axes ticks / labels.

## Answers

#1) There are missing values in our data, so we need to specify 
#`na.rm = TRUE`. 

min(CHM_HARV_df$layer, na.rm = TRUE)
max(CHM_HARV_df$layer, na.rm = TRUE)


#2) Possible ways include: 
#* Create a histogram
#* Use the `min()` and `max()` functions.
#* Print the object and look at the `values` attribute.

#3)

ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
     geom_histogram(aes(layer))

#4)

ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
     geom_histogram(aes(layer), colour="black", 
                    fill="darkgreen", bins = 6)

#5) 

custom_bins <- c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40)
CHM_HARV_df <- CHM_HARV_df %>%
                   mutate(canopy_discrete = cut(layer, breaks = custom_bins))
 
ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = CHM_HARV_df , aes(x = x, y = y,
                                        fill = canopy_discrete)) + 
     scale_fill_manual(values = terrain.colors(4)) + 
   coord_quickmap()

## Efficient Raster Calculations: Overlay Function

#Raster math, like we just did, is an appropriate approach to raster 
#calculations if:

#1. The rasters we are using are small in size.
#2. The calculations we are performing are simple.

#However, raster math is a less efficient approach as computation becomes more
#complex or as file sizes become large. The `overlay()` function is more 
#efficient when:

#1. The rasters we are using are larger in size.
#2. The rasters are stored as individual files.
#3. The computations performed are complex.

#The `overlay()` function takes two or more rasters and applies a function to
#them using efficient processing methods. The syntax is

#`outputRaster <- overlay(raster1, raster2, fun=functionName)`

## Data Tip

#If the rasters are stacked and stored as `RasterStack` or 
#`RasterBrick` objects in R, then we should use `calc()`. 
#`overlay()` will not work on stacked rasters.

#Let's perform the same subtraction calculation that we 
#calculated above using raster math, using the `overlay()` function.

## Data Tip

#A custom function consists of a defined set of 
#commands performed on a input object. Custom functions are 
#particularly useful for tasks that need to be repeated over and 
#over in the code. A simplified syntax for writing a custom function in R is:

#`function_name <- function(variable1, variable2) { WhatYouWantDone, WhatToReturn}`

CHM_ov_HARV <- overlay(DSM_HARV,
                       DTM_HARV,
                       fun = function(r1, r2) { return( r1 - r2) })


#Next we need to convert our new object to a data frame for plotting with 
#`ggplot`. 

CHM_ov_HARV_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_ov_HARV, xy = TRUE)

#Now we can plot the CHM:

 ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = CHM_ov_HARV_df, 
               aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) + 
   scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
   coord_quickmap()

#How do the plots of the CHM created with manual raster math 
#and the `overlay()`
 
 
#function compare?

## Export a GeoTIFF

#Now that we've created a new raster, let's export the data as a 
#GeoTIFF file using the `writeRaster()` function.

#When we write this raster object to a GeoTIFF file we'll name 
#it `CHM_HARV.tiff`. This name allows us to quickly remember 
#both what the data contains (CHM data) and for where 
#(HARVard Forest). The `writeRaster()` function
#by default writes the output file to your working 
#directory unless you specify a full file path.

#We will specify the output format ("GTiff"), the no data 
#value (`NAflag = -9999`. We will also tell R to overwrite 
#any data that is already in a file of the same name. 

writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "CHM_HARV.tiff",
            format="GTiff",
            overwrite=TRUE,
            NAflag=-9999)


### writeRaster() Options

#The function arguments that we used above include:

#**format:** specify that the format will be `GTiff` or GeoTIFF.
#**overwrite:** If TRUE, R will overwrite any existing file  
#with the same name in the specified directory. USE THIS 
#SETTING WITH CAUTION!
#**NAflag:** set the GeoTIFF tag for `NoDataValue` to -9999, 
#the National Ecological Observatory Network's 
#(NEON) standard `NoDataValue`.

## Challenge: Explore the NEON San Joaquin Experimental 
#Range Field Site

#Data are often more interesting and powerful when we 
#compare them across various locations. Let's compare some 
#data collected over Harvard Forest to data collected in Southern 
#California. The NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) 
#(https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER)
#located in Southern California has a very different ecosystem 
#and climate than NEON Harvard Forest Field Site
#(https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV)
#in Massachusetts.

#Import the SJER DSM and DTM raster files and create a 
#Canopy Height Model. Then compare the two sites. Be sure to 
#name your R objects and outputs carefully, as follows: 
#objectType_SJER (e.g. `DSM_SJER`). This will help you
#keep track of data from different sites!

#You should have the DSM and DTM data for the SJER site already
#loaded. Don't forget to check the CRSs and units of the data.

#1. Create a CHM from the two raster layers and check to make 
#sure the data are what you expect.

#2. Plot the CHM from SJER.

#3. Export the SJER CHM as a GeoTIFF.

#4. Compare the vegetation structure of the Harvard Forest and 
#San Joaquin Experimental Range.

## Answers

#1) Use the `overlay()` function to subtract the two rasters & 
#   create the CHM.

CHM_ov_SJER <- overlay(DSM_SJER,
                        DTM_SJER,
                        fun = function(r1, r2){ return(r1 - r2) })

#Convert the output to a dataframe:

CHM_ov_SJER_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_ov_SJER, xy = TRUE)


#Create a histogram to check that the data distribution makes sense: 

ggplot(CHM_ov_SJER_df) +
     geom_histogram(aes(layer))


#2) Create a plot of the CHM: 

  ggplot() +
       geom_raster(data = CHM_ov_SJER_df, 
               aes(x = x, y = y, 
                    fill = layer)
               ) + 
      scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", 
         colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
      coord_quickmap()

 
#3) Export the CHM object to a file: 

writeRaster(CHM_ov_SJER, "chm_ov_SJER.tiff",
             format = "GTiff",
             overwrite = TRUE,
             NAflag = -9999)


#4) Compare the SJER and HARV CHMs. 
#Tree heights are much shorter in SJER. You can confirm this by 
#looking at the histograms of the two CHMs. 

 ggplot(CHM_HARV_df) +
     geom_histogram(aes(layer))

 ggplot(CHM_ov_SJER_df) +
     geom_histogram(aes(layer))
