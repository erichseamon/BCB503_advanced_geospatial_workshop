#This episode covers how to work with and plot a raster time series, using an
#R RasterStack object. It also covers practical assessment of data quality in
#remote sensing derived imagery. 

## About Raster Time Series Data

#A raster data file can contain one single band or many bands. If the raster 
#data contains imagery data, each band may represent reflectance for a 
#different wavelength (color or type of light) or set of wavelengths - 
#for example red, green and blue. A multi-band raster may two or more 
#bands or layers of data collected at different times for the same extent 
#(region) and of the same resolution. For this episode, we will work with 
#a time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and RGB 
#data from the Harvard Forest site.  We introduced the concepts of NDVI and 
#RGB data previously.

#In this episode, we will:

#1. Import NDVI data in GeoTIFF format.
#2. Import, explore and plot NDVI data derived for several dates throughout 
#the year.
#3. View the RGB imagery used to derived the NDVI time series to better
#understand unusual / outlier values.

## RGB Data

#While the NDVI data is a single band product, the RGB images that contain the
#red band used to derive NDVI, contain 3 (of the 7) 30m resolution bands
#available from Landsat data. The RGB directory contains RGB images for 
#each time period that NDVI is available.

### Getting Started

#In this episode, we will use the `raster`, `rgdal`, `reshape`, and 
#`scales` packages. Make sure you have them loaded.

library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(reshape)
library(scales)


#To begin, we will create a list of raster files using the `list.files()`
#function. This list will be used to generate a RasterStack. We will
#only add files that have a `.tif` extension to our list. To do this, we 
#will use the syntax `pattern=".tif$"`. If we specify `full.names = TRUE`, 
#the full path for each file will be added to the list.

## Data Tip
#In the pattern above, the `$` character represents the end of a line. 
#Using it ensures that our pattern will only match files that end in `.tif`. 
#This pattern matching uses a  language called "regular expressions", which 
#is beyond the scope of this workshop. 
 
NDVI_HARV_path <- "data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/NDVI"

all_NDVI_HARV <- list.files(NDVI_HARV_path,
                            full.names = TRUE,
                            pattern = ".tif$")


#It's a good idea to look at the file names that matched our search 
#to make sure they meet our expectations. 

all_NDVI_HARV


#Now we have a list of all GeoTIFF files in the NDVI directory for Harvard
#Forest. Next, we will create a RasterStack from this list using the `stack()`
#function. 

NDVI_HARV_stack <- stack(all_NDVI_HARV)

#We can explore the GeoTIFF tags (the embedded metadata) in a stack using the
#same syntax that we used on single-band raster objects in R including: `crs()`
#(coordinate reference system), `extent()` and `res()` (resolution; 
#specifically `yres()` and `xres()`).

crs(NDVI_HARV_stack)


#The CRS for our stack is `+proj=utm +zone=19 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs`. 
#The CRS is in UTM Zone 19. If you have completed the previous episodes in
#this workshop, you may have noticed that the UTM zone for the NEON collected 
#remote sensing data was in Zone 18 rather than Zone 19. Why are the 
#Landsat data in Zone 19?

#A Landsat scene is extremely wide - spanning over 170km north to
#south and 180km east to west. This means that Landsat data often cover 
#multiple UTM zones. When the data are processed, the zone in which 
#the majority of the data cover is the zone which is used for the final 
#CRS. Thus, our field site at Harvard Forest is located in UTM Zone 18, 
#but the Landsat data is in a CRS of UTM Zone 19.

## Challenge: Raster Metadata

#Investigate the metadata for our RasterStack and answer the following 
#questions.

# 1. What are the x and y resolution of the data?
# 2. What units are the above resolution in?

## Answers

 extent(NDVI_HARV_stack)
 yres(NDVI_HARV_stack)
 xres(NDVI_HARV_stack)



## Plotting Time Series Data
 #Once we have created our RasterStack, we can visualize our data. We can use
 #the `ggplot()` command to create a multi-panelled plot showing each band 
 #in our RasterStack. First we need to create a data frame object. 
 #Because there are multiple bands in our data, we will reshape (or "melt")
 #the data so that we have a single column with the NDVI observations. 
 #We will use the function `melt()` from the `reshape` package to do this: 

NDVI_HARV_stack_df <- as.data.frame(NDVI_HARV_stack, xy = TRUE) %>%
    melt(id.vars = c('x','y'))

#Now we can plot our data using `ggplot()`. We want
#to create a separate panel for each time point in our
#time series, so we will use the `facet_wrap()` 
#function to create a multi-paneled plot: 

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = NDVI_HARV_stack_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable)


#Look at the range of NDVI values observed in the plot above. We know that
#the accepted values for NDVI range from 0-1. Why does our data range from
#0 - 10,000?

## Scale Factors

#The metadata for this NDVI data specifies a scale factor: 10,000. 
#A scale factor is sometimes used to maintain smaller file sizes by 
#removing decimal places. Storing data in integer format keeps files 
#sizes smaller.

#Let's apply the scale factor before we go any further. Conveniently, we can
#quickly apply this factor using raster math on the entire stack as follows:

NDVI_HARV_stack <- NDVI_HARV_stack/10000


#After applying our scale factor, we can recreate our plot using the 
#same code we used above.

#NDVI_HARV_stack_df <- as.data.frame(NDVI_HARV_stack, xy = TRUE) %>%
#    melt(id.vars = c('x','y'))

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = NDVI_HARV_stack_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable)


## Take a Closer Look at Our Data

#Let's take a closer look at the plots of our data. Massachusetts, 
#where the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site is located, has a fairly consistent
#fall, winter, spring, and summer season where vegetation turns green in the
#spring, continues to grow throughout the summer, and begins to change colors 
#and senesce in the fall through winter. Do you notice anything that seems 
#unusual about the patterns of greening and browning observed in the plots 
#above?

#Hint: the number after the "X" in each tile title is the Julian day which in
#this case represents the number of days into each year. If you are unfamiliar
#with Julian day, check out the NEON Data Skills tutorial.

## View Distribution of Raster Values
#In the above exercise, we viewed plots of our NDVI time series and noticed a
#few images seem to be unusually light. However this was only a visual
#representation of potential issues in our data. What is another way we can look
#at these data that is quantitative?

#Next we will use histograms to explore the distribution of NDVI values 
#stored in each raster.

ggplot(NDVI_HARV_stack_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(value)) +
    facet_wrap(~variable)


#It seems like things get green in the spring and summer like we expect, but 
#the data at Julian days 277 and 293 are unusual. It appears as if the 
#vegetation got green in the spring, but then died back only to get 
#green again towards the end of the year. Is this right?

### Explore Unusual Data Patterns
#The NDVI data that we are using comes from 2011, perhaps a strong freeze 
#around Julian day 277 could cause a vegetation to senesce early, 
#however in the eastern United States, it seems unusual that it would 
#proceed to green up again shortly thereafter.

#Let's next view some temperature data for our field site to see whether there
#were some unusual fluctuations that may explain this pattern of greening and
#browning seen in the NDVI data. First we will read in the temperature data and preview the structure
#of that dataframe:

har_met_daily <-
  read.csv("data/NEON-DS-Met-Time-Series/HARV/FisherTower-Met/hf001-06-daily-m.csv")

str(har_met_daily)


#The `date` column is currently coded as a factor. We want to be able to 
#treat it as a date,so we will use the `as.Date()` function to convert it. 
#We need to tell R what format the data is in. Our dates are YYY-MM-DD, 
#which is represented by R as `%Y-%m-%d`.

har_met_daily$date <- as.Date(har_met_daily$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")


#We only want to look at the data from 2011:

yr_11_daily_avg <- subset(har_met_daily,
                            date >= as.Date('2011-01-01') &
                            date <= as.Date('2011-12-31'))


#Now we can plot the air temperature (the `airt` column) by Julian day 
#(the `jd` column):

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = yr_11_daily_avg, aes(jd, airt)) +

#+ geom_point(data = yr_11_daily_avg, aes(jd, airtmax), color="red") + geom_point(data = #yr_11_daily_avg, aes(jd, airtmin), color="blue") +
  
  ggtitle("Daily Mean Air Temperature",
          subtitle = "NEON Harvard Forest Field Site") +
  xlab("Julian Day 2011") +
  ylab("Mean Air Temperature (C)")


#There are no significant peaks or dips in the temperature during the late 
#summer or early fall time period that might account for patterns seen 
#in the NDVI data.  Let's have a look at the source Landsat imagery that 
#was partially used used to derive our NDVI rasters to try to understand what appear to be outlier NDVI values.

# Plot RGB data for Julian day 133

RGB_133 <- stack("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/133_HARV_landRGB.tif")

## Challenge: Examine RGB Raster Files

#Plot the RGB images for the Julian days 277 and 293. Compare those with the RGB 
#plots for Julian days 133 and 197 (shown above). Does the RGB imagery from these two days explain the low NDVI values observed on these days?

## Answers

#First we need to load in the RGB data for Julian day 277 and look at its metadata.
 
RGB_277 <- stack("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/277_HARV_landRGB.tif")
RGB_277


#The RGB data has a max value of 255, but we need our color intensity to be between 0 and 1, so we will divide our RasterStack object by 255.

RGB_277 <- RGB_277/255

#Next we convert it to a dataframe. 
 
RGB_277_df <- as.data.frame(RGB_277, xy = TRUE)



#We create RGB colors from the three channels:

RGB_277_df$rgb <- with(RGB_277_df, rgb(X277_HARV_landRGB.1, X277_HARV_landRGB.2, X277_HARV_landRGB.3,1))


#Finally, we can plot the RGB data for Julian day 277. 
 
ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data=RGB_277_df, aes(x, y), fill=RGB_277_df$rgb) + 
   ggtitle("Julian day 277") 


#We then do the same steps for Julian day 293
 
# Julian day 293
RGB_293 <- stack("data/NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/RGB/293_HARV_landRGB.tif")
RGB_293 <- RGB_293/255
RGB_293_df <- as.data.frame(RGB_293, xy = TRUE)
RGB_293_df$rgb <- with(RGB_293_df, rgb(X293_HARV_landRGB.1, X293_HARV_landRGB.2, X293_HARV_landRGB.3,1))
ggplot() +
   geom_raster(data = RGB_293_df, aes(x, y), fill = RGB_293_df$rgb) +
   ggtitle("Julian day 293")


#This example highlights the importance of
#exploring the source of a derived data product. In this case, the NDVI data
#product was created using Landsat imagery - specifically the red
#and near-infrared bands. When we look at the RGB collected at Julian days 277 and 293 
#we see that most of the image is filled with clouds. The very low NDVI values resulted from cloud cover — a common challenge that we encounter when working with satellite remote
#sensing imagery.
