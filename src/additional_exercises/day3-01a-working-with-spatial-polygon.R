# 
# ## Age Adjusted Lung & Bronchus Cancer Mortality Rates by County
# 
# Age Adjusted Lung & Bronchus Cancer Mortality Rates from 1980 t0 2014 by county was obtained from 
# [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/us-data). The 
# rate was estimated using spatially explicit Bayesian mixed effects regression models for both 
# males and females [(Mokdad et al., 2016)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2598772). 
# The model incorporated 7 covariates, such as  proportion of the adult population that graduated high school, 
# the proportion of the population that is Hispanic, the proportion of the population that is black, 
# the proportion of the population that is a race other than black or white, The proportion of a county 
# that is contained within a state or federal Native American reservation, the median household income, 
# and the population density.  To reduce the noise due to low mortality rate in a small population size, 
# we smoothed data with the [Empirical Bayesian smoother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method),  
# a tool for dealing with rate instability associated with small sample sizes.  It takes the population in the 
# region as an indicator of confidence in the data, with higher population providing a higher confidence in the 
# value at that location.  We used  [SpaceStat](https://www.biomedware.com/?module=Page&sID=spacestat) (Evaluation version) 
# Software for smoothing data. 
# 
# 
# ## Age-standardized Cigarette Smoking (%) Prevalence by County
# 
# Age-standardized cigarette smoking (%) prevalence by County estimated from the 
# [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html) 
# survey data [(Dwyer-Lindgren et al., 2014)](https://pophealthmetrics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-7954-12-5).  
# The prevalence (%) were estimated by logistic hierarchical mixed effects regression models, stratified by sex. 
# All estimates were age-standardized following the age structure of the 2000 census. The uncertainty of the 
# prevalence estimates was assessed using simulation methods.
# 
# 
# ## Age-standardized Poverty Rate by County 
# 
# County-level poverty data (% population below poverty level)  are from US Census 
# [Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/about.html) 
# Program. Income and poverty rate were estimated by combining survey data with population estimates and administrative records. 
# 
# 
# ## Particulate Matter (PM2.5)
# 
# Annual mean PM2.5 from 1998 to 2012 were modeled from aerosol optical depth from multiple satellite 
# ([Multiangle Imaging Spectra Radiometer](https://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/), 
#   [MODIS Dark Target](https://darktarget.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/land-10), 
#   [MODIS and SeaWiFS Deep Blue](https://deepblue.gsfc.nasa.gov/science), 
#   [MODIS MAIAC](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/v1/productGroupPage/name=maiac))  
# products  and validated by ground-based PM2.5 monitoring sites 
# [(Aaron van Donkelaar et al., 2016)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b05833).  
# All raster grid of PM2.5 were re-sampled at 2.5 km x 2 km grid size using [Empirical Bayesian Kriging]
# (http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/extensions/geostatistical-analyst/what-is-empirical-bayesian-kriging-.htm) 
# in ArcPython - Geo-statistical Tool [(ESRI, 2017)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)). 
# County population weighted mean for each year were calculated from the population data.    
# 
# 
# ## Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
# 
# Annual mean ambient NO2 Concentrations estimated from three satellite instruments, such as  
# [Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/ers/instruments/gome),  
# [Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY)]
# (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009457659400278T) and [GOME-2]
# (http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/atmosphere/gome/gome-A.html) satellite  
# in combination with chemical transport model [(Gedders et al., (2016)]
# (https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1409567/). All raster grid of PM2.5 were re-sampled at 2.5 km x 2 km grid size using 
# [Empirical Bayesian Kriging]
# (http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/extensions/geostatistical-analyst/what-is-empirical-bayesian-kriging-.htm) 
# in ArcPython - Geo-statistical Tool [(ESRI, 2017)](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)). County population weighted mean for 
# each year were calculated from the population data.
#                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   


# 
# ## Sulfer dioxide (SO2)
# 
# Annual mean ambient SO2 Concentrations estimated were obtained from time series Multi-source SO2 emission retrievals 
# and consistency of satellite and surface measurements of [(Fioletov et al,(2017)]
# (https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/12597/2017https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/17/12597/2017/).
